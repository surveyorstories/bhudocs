### Algorithm Overview

The **Village Map Algorithm** is designed to generate a detailed village map by incorporating various parameters such as the **village boundary**, **Land parcel details**,**Topo details** and notifications related to survey. The algorithm allows users to input data on land parcels, village details, and survey notifications, and outputs a final map aligned with the required survey standards.

### Pre-Requisite Steps

Before running the algorithm, ensure that:

1. **Project Saving**:

   - Ensure that the project is saved. The algorithm depends on saved project settings for output management.

2. **Layer Setup**:

   - Make sure the **village boundary layer** and **government land layer** are available in the project.

3. **Projection Consistency**:

   - Ensure that the project and layers are in the same **Projection (CRS)** to avoid issues during processing.

## How To

### 1. Create Topo Layers

- **Before running the algorithm**, use the **Create Topo Layers** tool from the toolset. This tool generates the following layers:
  
  - **TopoPoint**: Point layer for topographic features.
  - **TopoLine**: Line layer for topographic features.
  - **TopoPolygon**: Polygon layer for topographic features.
  - These layers are necessary for proper visualization and representation of topographic data in the generated map. for detailed instructions visit [**How to create Topo Layers**](./toolset#1-topo-layers)

### 2. Prepare Your Data

- Ensure all input files (village shape file, government land shape file) are properly loaded in the project.
- Fill in the required fields, such as LPM number column, total number of land parcels, and other village details.

### 3. Run the Algorithm

- Launch the **Village Map Algorithm** by filling in the input parameters.

- The algorithm will:
  
  - Generate a village map with LPM boundaries and government land Parcels.
  - Include survey notifications and revision details as per input fields.

### 4. Output

- The generated village map will include:
  - A detailed map with the **LPM boundaries** and **government land boundaries**.
  - Template of village map with village data aligned
  - Embedded notifications related to land surveys into village map template.

## Post-Processing Steps

After running the algorithm, you can perform the following post-processing steps:

1. **Review Map Accuracy**:

   - Check the generated map to ensure that LPM boundaries and government land parcels are correctly represented.

2. **Side Village Customization**:

   - Easily add side village names and frill lines using pre-generated layers.

3. **Modify Survey Details**:

   - If there are any discrepancies in the survey year, extent, or notification details, adjust the relevant fields in master panel or  re-run the algorithm if necessary with appropriate data.

4. **Final Template Adjustments**:

   - Make any required adjustments to the **A0**  template based on project requirements.

5. **Verify Output Layers**:

   - Ensure all generated layers (e.g., village map, land boundaries, notification details, and topo layers) are correctly aligned and properly labeled.

## Key Considerations

- **Projection Consistency**: Ensure all layers and the project are in the same CRS (Coordinate Reference System) to avoid alignment issues during processing.

- **Save the Project**: Always save the project before running the algorithm to ensure proper output file management.

- **Topo Layers**: The **TopoPoint**, **TopoLine**, and **TopoPolygon** layers are required for topographic representation and should be created before running the algorithm.

- **Survey Notifications**: The algorithm handles multiple notifications (e.g., notification 6(1) Gazette, RC notifications) for proper documentation of land survey processes.

- **Preserve Layer Names**: Changing the names of layers generated by the algorithm will disrupt functionality.

## Important Notes

- The algorithm requires that **LPM number column** and other required fields are correctly specified in the input shape files to ensure accurate processing.
- The **District Name**, **Mandal Name**, and **Village Name** should match exactly as required for official documentation and notifications.

This documentation outlines the steps required to execute the **Village Map Algorithm**, ensuring that all parameters are set correctly for accurate map generation and output, including the creation of topographic layers before running the algorithm.
