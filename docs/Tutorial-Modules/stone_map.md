## How to

### Run algorithm

:::info

All the Files(layers) generated by algorithm are stored in the **project directory**

:::

1. Save the project and set the projection of the project.

2. Load the village final shapefile and Government land shapefile into the project we can done this by **Layer>Add Layer > Add vector Layer** browse and select the appropriate layer or simple drag and drop the layer into the project.

3. Launch Stone map algorithm **Alt + Shift+ S**  (available at processing toolbox, Bhukamatha toolbar, Plugin menu),

4. Fill out all the data accordingly,

5. Now simply click on the Run Button located on the bottom right side

6. Now all the work will done by algorithm sit still and wait until it completes.

7. It will generate all the Required layers (**Land_Parcel_Stones, Government_Land_Stones, Field_Tri-Junction_Stones, Side_Village_Frill_Line, Side_VillageLayer**) for you Â 

:::tip

Adding of Stone map Layout with all the details including Stone Count was done for you by Bhukamatha no need to done manually

:::

### Remaining things ToDo

1. Add the Bi-Junction (Old,New) Stones  and Tri-Junction (Old,New) Stones using any existing Stone Layers,

2. Change the stones where it is Necessary by selecting appropriate Layer,

3. Add Side village Frill lines using the line layer **Side_Village_Frill_Line**,

4. Add Side Village Names using the Point Layer  **Side_VillageLayer** (No need to set symbology opacity to '0' Bhukamatha removes the opacity when the template is opened, when closed changes to Orange).

:::warning

Changing  any  layer name generated by Bhukamatha algorithm will break the project 

:::

## Points to Remember

- Save the project beforehand (Bhukamtha doesn't allow to run the algorithm without saving because it was mostly dependent on project)

- Before proceeding to run the algorithm make sure all the data was correctly mapped and typed 

- Check the Projection of the project and Shapefile are correct and matching

- All the stone count in the map are auto calculated in the layout  

- Not to change any layer name which are generated through Bhukamtha stone map algorithm
