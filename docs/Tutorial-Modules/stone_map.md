This documentation is primarily generated by AI and may contain inaccuracies or incomplete information. A thorough manual review is still pending. Please [Report](../../feedback) any errors, inconsistencies, or suggestions for improvement to ensure accuracy and reliability.

:::warning  
**Gautami** font must be installed to generate a Stone Map using Bhukamatha.  
:::

###### **Pre-Requisite Steps**

Before running the algorithm, ensure the following:

1. **Project Consistency**:

   - Both **Village Final Shape File** and **Government Land Shape File** layers must be in the **same projection** to avoid any misalignment during processing. Verify the projection settings of the layers and the project to ensure they match.
   - If needed, adjust the projection by right-clicking the layer and choosing **Layer CRS** or adjusting the **Project CRS** settings.

2. **Save the Project**:

   - The QGIS project must be saved before running the algorithm, as it depends on the project directory for saving output files and layers.
   - Ensure that all layers are correctly loaded and saved in the project to maintain integrity during the algorithm execution.

## Data Requirements

The following data fields are required to generate a **Stone Map** using Bhukamatha:

| **Column**                     | **Description**                                                                             | **Type**         |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Village Final Shape File**   | Final approved village shapefile                                                            | Shapefile        |
| **Choose Your LPM Column**     | Column representing the LP Number in the village final shapefile                            | Dropdown         |
| **Government Land Shape File** | Shapefile containing all government land parcels, distinct from the village final shapefile | Shapefile        |
| **Choose Your District**       | District name, selected from the drop-down                                                  | Drop-down (Name) |
| **Mandal Name (in Telugu)**    | Mandal name, entered in Telugu                                                              | Name (Telugu)    |
| **Village Name (in Telugu)**   | Revenue village name, entered in Telugu                                                     | Name (Telugu)    |
| **Gazette Date**               | 13<sup>th</sup> Notification Gazette Date                                                   | Date             |
| **Gazette No**                 | 13<sup>th</sup> Notification Number                                                         | Text (Number)    |

## Steps to Generate a Stone Map

### 1. Prepare Your Data

- Save the QGIS project and set the correct projection.
- Load the **Village Final Shapefile** and **Government Land Shapefile** into the project:
  - Use **Layer > Add Layer > Add Vector Layer** to browse and load the files, or simply drag and drop them into the project.

### 2. Launch the Algorithm

- Open the **Stone Map Algorithm** by:
  - Pressing **Alt + Shift + S**.
  - Navigating via the **Processing Toolbox**, **Bhukamatha Toolbar**, or **Plugin Menu**.

### 3. Fill Out the Details

- Provide all required fields as listed in the **Data Requirements** section.
- Double-check entries for accuracy (e.g., ensure Telugu names are typed correctly).

### 4. Run the Algorithm

- Click the **Run** button located at the bottom-right of the interface.  
- The algorithm will:
  - Generate all required layers, including:
    - **Land_Parcel_Stones**
    - **Government_Land_Stones**
    - **Field_Tri-Junction_Stones**
    - **Side_Village_Frill_Line**
    - **Side_VillageLayer**
  - Automatically create and populate the Stone Map layout with all necessary details, including the stone count.

:::info  
All layers and files generated by the algorithm are saved in the **project directory**.  
:::

### 5. Final Edits (Post-Processing)

After the algorithm completes:

1. **Add Junction Stones**:  
   - Insert **Bi-Junction (Old/New)** and **Tri-Junction (Old/New)** stones using existing stone layers.  
2. **Adjust Stones**:  
   - Update or modify stone locations if necessary, selecting the appropriate layer.  
3. **Side Village Frill Lines**:  
   - Use the **Side_Village_Frill_Line** layer to add required frill lines.  
4. **Add Side Village Names**:  
   - Use the **Side_VillageLayer** point layer to label side villages.  
   - **Note**: Bhukamatha automatically manages the opacity of this layer. It will appear with full opacity in the template and revert to orange when the template is closed.

:::warning  
Avoid renaming any layers generated by the Bhukamatha Stone Map algorithm, as this will break the project.  
:::

## Points to Remember

- **Save Your Project**:  
  
  - The algorithm cannot run without a saved project, as it depends on the project directory.

- **Verify Data**:  
  
  - Ensure all required shapefiles and fields are mapped and entered correctly.

- **Projection Consistency**:  
  
  - Verify that the project and shapefiles share the same projection system.

- **Preserve Layer Names**:  
  
  - Changing the names of layers generated by the algorithm will disrupt functionality.

## Key Features

1. **Automated Stone Map Layout**:  

   - Bhukamatha generates the layout with all details, eliminating manual effort.

2. **Data Integration**:  

   - Automatically integrates shapefile data into the layout.

3. **Side Village Customization**:  

   - Easily add side village names and frill lines using pre-generated layers.
