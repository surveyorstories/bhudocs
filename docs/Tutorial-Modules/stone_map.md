## How to

### Run algorithm

:::info

All the Files(layers) generated by the algorithm are stored in the **project directory**

:::

1. Save the project and set the projection of the project.

2. Load the village final shapefile and Government land shapefile into the project we can done this by **Layer>Add Layer > Add vector Layer, then browse and pick the appropriate layer or just drag and drop it into the project.

3. Launch the Stone map algorithm by pressing Alt + Shift + S (accessible in the processing toolbox, Bhukamatha toolbar, or Plugin menu).

4. Fill out all of the details accordingly.

5. Now simply click on the Run Button located on the bottom right side

6. Now all the work will done by algorithm, sit still and wait until it completes.

7. It will generate all the Required layers (**Land_Parcel_Stones, Government_Land_Stones, Field_Tri-Junction_Stones, Side_Village_Frill_Line, Side_VillageLayer**) for you Â 

:::tip

Adding of Stone map Layout with all the details including Stone Count was done for you by Bhukamatha no need to do it manually

:::

### Remaining things ToDo

1. Add the Bi-Junction (Old,New) Stones  and Tri-Junction (Old,New) Stones using any existing Stone Layers,

2. Change the stones where it is Necessary by selecting appropriate Layers,

3. Add Side village Frill lines using the line layer **Side_Village_Frill_Line**,

4. Add Side Village Names using the Point Layer  **Side_VillageLayer** (No need to set symbology opacity to '0' Bhukamatha removes the opacity when the template is opened, when closed changes to Orange).

:::warning

Changing  any  layer name generated by the Bhukamatha algorithm will break the project 

:::

## Points to Remember

- Save the project beforehand (Bhukamatha doesn't allow running the algorithm without saving because it was mostly dependent on the project)

- Before running the algorithm, ensure that all of the data is appropriately mapped and typed.

- Check the Projection of the project and Shapefile are correct and matching

- Don't change any layer names that are generated by the Bhukamatha stone map algorithm
