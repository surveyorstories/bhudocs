## **How To Use the Tools**

## 1. Topo Layers

This tool generates three essential Topo Layers: Topo Point, Topo Line, and Topo Polygon.

### How to Use

1. **Save and Set the Project Projection**  
   Ensure the project is saved and the appropriate projection is set.

2. **Add a Base Layer**

   - Go to **Layer > Add Layer > Add Vector Layer** to browse and select your base layer.
   - Alternatively, you can drag and drop the layer into the project.

3. **Open Tool Set**

   - Access the **Tool Set** by clicking the icon or using the shortcut **ALT + SHIFT + T**.

4. **Create Topo Layers**

   - Click on **Create Topo Layers**. This will generate three new layers:
     - **TopoPoint**
     - **TopoLine**
     - **TopoPolygon**

5. **Edit and Add Features**

   - Toggle the edit mode for each layer.
   - Click on **Add Features** to add geometry (Point, Line, Polygon).
   - After adding a feature, a dropdown menu will appear. Select the corresponding topo type from the list.

6. **Set for LPM Generation**

   - Once the layers are prepared, click the **'Set for LPMs'** button under the **Topo Layers** section to set the layers for Land Parcel Mapping (LPM) generation.

7. **Revert to Normal Mode**

   - If you need to revert the layers from LPM mode to normal, simply click the **'Revert'** button.

## 2. Side Village

This tool generates a side village layer, essential for Land Parcel generation.

### How to Use

1. **Open Tool Set**

   - Access the **Tool Set** as previously described.

2. **Select Village Final Shapefile**

   - From the **Side Village** section, select your **Village Final Shapefile** from the dropdown list.

3. **Create Side Village Layer**

   - Click the **Create Side Village Layer** button. This will create a new layer called **'Side_Villages'** in your project.

4. **Split the Layer at Tri-junctions**

   - Split the layer based on village tri-junctions. Input the corresponding names and village codes into the attribute table.
   - Save the layer.

5. **Set for LPM Generation**

   - Click the **'Set for LPMs'** button in the **Topo Layers** section to mark this layer for LPM generation.

## 3. Create a Layer from Selected Features

This tool allows you to create a new layer based on the features selected from the active layer.

### How to Use

1. **Select a Layer**

   - Choose a layer from the **Layer Panel**.

2. **Select Features**

   - Use the **Selection Toolbar** to select the features you wish to include in the new layer.

3. **Create New Layer**

   - Click on the **Tool Set** panel, then click the **Create New Layer** button. A new layer containing only the selected features will be added to the project.

4. **Optional: Create a Temporary Layer**

   - If you want to create a temporary layer, check the box **Create a Temporary Layer** before clicking **Create New Layer**.

## 4. Base Map Selection Tool

#### Overview

The Base Map Selection Tool allows users to add various map layers to their projects with ease. This feature is designed to provide flexibility and a user-friendly interface for selecting and integrating base maps, such as Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, and Bing Earth, into your application.

### Features

1. **Dropdown Menu (ComboBox):**
   - Select from predefined base map options like Open Street Map, Google Maps, Google Satellite, etc.
2. **Submit Button:**
   - Click to add the selected base map layer to your application.

### How to Use

#### 1. Launch the Tool

Open the application, and the Base Map Selection Tool is accessible within the main interface.

#### 2. Select a Base Map

- Locate the dropdown menu labeled **"Select Base Map Layer."**
- Click on the dropdown arrow to reveal the list of available base maps.
- Options include:
  - Open Street Map
  - Google Map
  - Google Satellite
  - Google Satellite Hybrid
  - Google Satellite Terrain Hybrid
  - Bing Earth

#### 3. Add the Map Layer

- Once you select a base map, click the **"Add Layer"** button
- you may see a confirmation message.
- The selected map layer is immediately added to your project.
