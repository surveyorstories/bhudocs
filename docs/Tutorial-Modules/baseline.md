# Baseline Tool - User Documentation

## Overview

The **Baseline Tool** in QGIS allows users to create baseline geometries (lines or circles) based on a user-defined distance. This tool helps in digitizing and mapping linear and circular features with precision.

## Features

- Supports **line and circle** geometries.
- Allows users to enter a specific **distance value** for precise placement.
- Provides **snapping** to existing features for accurate alignment.
- Includes a **preview mode** before finalizing the geometry.
- Supports **multiple measurement units**:
  - **Meters**
  - **Metric Links**
  - **Guntur's Links**

## How to Use

### 1. Activating the Tool

1. Click on the **Baseline Tool** in the QGIS toolbar.
2. The tool will be activated, and the mouse cursor will change accordingly.

### 2. Selecting a Start Point

1. Left-click on the map to select the starting point for the baseline.
2. The tool will highlight the chosen location with a **green marker**.

### 3. Entering Distance and Selecting Geometry

1. A dialog box will appear prompting you to enter the **distance**.
2. Select the desired **unit of measurement**.
3. Choose the **geometry type**:
   - **Line**: A straight segment of the specified distance.
   - **Circle**: A circular feature with the given radius.
4. Click **OK** to confirm.

### 4. Previewing the Geometry

- Move the cursor to see a **preview** of the feature.
- The tool will display:
  - A **dashed line** for line geometry.
  - A **dashed circle** for circular geometry.
- If needed, right-click to **cancel** the operation.

### 5. Finalizing the Geometry

1. Left-click again to confirm the geometry.
2. The feature will be added to the **Baseline layer**.
3. The tool will automatically reset for a new operation.

## Additional Features

- **Snapping Support**: The tool will snap to existing features based on QGIS's snapping settings.
- **Length Attribute**: Each feature stores its **measured distance** in the attribute table.
- **Undo Support**: If needed, remove the last created feature and retry.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. Distance Input Issues

- Ensure that the entered **distance is greater than 0**.
- Check that the distance value is **within valid range (0.01 - 10,000 meters)**.

### 2. Snapping Not Working

- Verify that **snapping is enabled** in QGIS settings.
- Adjust **snapping tolerance** for better results.

### 3. Feature Not Created

- Ensure that the **Baseline layer is editable**.
- If an error occurs, check the **QGIS message bar** for details.

## Conclusion

The **Baseline Tool** is a powerful QGIS extension for efficiently creating linear and circular baseline features. By allowing precise distance input and real-time preview, this tool enhances the digitization workflow.
